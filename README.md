# 3P-Gomoku
It is a 3-Player Gomoku developed with Pygame.
This is actually the first game I built. 
And I developed this game because I want to change the way our classmates play "知識王".
By combining the "知識王" and Gomoku, I turn the old tradition of playing normal "知識王" into a game that requires a lot of thinking and discussions.
Eventually we played it on 5/29/2019 with 90 students in our school.
